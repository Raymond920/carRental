## Getting Started

### Setting Up the React Native Client

1. Navigate to the Android client directory:
```bash
cd android-client
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Add Firebase configuration:
   - Download your `google-services.json` file from Firebase Console
   - Place it in the `android/app/` directory

4. Clean previous builds:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
```

5. Start the app:
```bash
npm start
```

### Setting Up the Authentication Service

1. Navigate to the authentication service directory:
```bash
cd auth-service
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. Run the server:
```bash
poetry run python server.py
```

The authentication server will start on port 5000: http://localhost:5000
### Setting Up the Chat WebSocket

1. Navigate to the Chat WebSocket directory:
```bash
cd chat-ws
```

2. Run the websocket server:
```bash
python chatWebSocket.py
```

The WebSocket server will start on port 5001: http://localhost:5001
## Integration

To connect the React Native app with the authentication service, create a `config.json` file in your React Native project's `src` directory:

```json
{
  "FLASK_API": "http://10.0.2.2:5000",  // For Android emulator
  // Use "http://localhost:5000" for iOS simulator
  // Use "http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:5000" for physical devices
  "WEBSOCKET_SERVER": "http://10.0.2.2:5001" // For Android emulator
  // Use "http://localhost:5001" for iOS simulator
  // Use "http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:5001" for physical devices
}
```

Then import it in your files:

```typescript
// Direct import
import config from '../../config.json';

// Then use it like:
const apiUrl = config.FLASK_API;
```

Make sure your `tsconfig.json` has JSON module resolution enabled:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    // ... other options
  }
}
```
